A simple trello clone application with Playwright tests added to them

The original version of this app was built by Filip Hric and [you can find it here](https://github.com/filiphric/trelloapp). I copied the application and added Playwright tests to it

How to install and start the app
`npm install`
`npm start`

That should do it. If you update the code, use `npx grunt dev` to build the app again.
